# twimba
A twitter clone

Twimba is a twitter clone, although it lacks a lot of the functionality of twitter. 

Currently, you can post a tweet, like, retweet, view replies, and reply to a tweet.

Future goals for twimba include, adding storage so that any new replies and tweets are not deleted.
Also adding the ability for a user to delete the tweets and replies that belong to them.
Also, add a feature that if a message is retweeted it appears at the top of the feed. Another, goal would 
that when a reply is posted it does not reload the entire document.
